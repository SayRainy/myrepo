1. clean and fix the hadoop cluster throughly.
1)delete files recursively under HADOOP_INSTALL_DIR/[logs] [tmp] for each node.
2)delete files recursively under HBASE_INSTALL_DIR/logs for each node.
3)execute cmd 'hdfs namenode -format' in namenode.
4)before starting the cluster, check and unify the NTP of the cluster.
note: make sure that the time difference between datanode and namenode must less than 30000ms default.

2. WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable
1)bug:
/home/hadoop/hadoop-2.6.0/lib/native/libhadoop.so.1.0.0: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 (Possible cause: architecture word width mismatch)
2)ana:
my machine os is Ubuntu14.04 i686 while the native libraries under the hadoop-2.6.0 installed are based on 64bit. 
3)sln:
fisrtly, export HADOOP_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=$HADOOP_HOME/lib/native".
